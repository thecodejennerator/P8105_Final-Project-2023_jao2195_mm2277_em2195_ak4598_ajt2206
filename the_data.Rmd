# Data Source

The Met offers open access to data of its collection. It can be found [here](https://github.com/metmuseum/openaccess).

# Data Cleaning

* The Met dataset consists of over 400,000 observations. A dataset of this size was far too big to handle.

* We took a look at missing data to decide how to subset the dataset into a smaller, more manageable size. The variables `object_name` and `accession_year` were complete. From that information, we took a random sample of 10% of the data, creating our final dataset of over 40,000 observations.

```{r echo = FALSE}
sapply(met, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
```

* Based on the missing data, we chose the following variables to work with: `is_highlight`, `department`, `accession_year`, `culture`, `object_data`, and `country`.
