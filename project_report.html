<div id="a-familiar-story" class="section level3">
<h3>A Familiar Story</h3>
<p>Your parents are in town. It’s raining, so your plan to pleasantly
stroll through Central Park and watch tourists row backwards on the Lake
is squashed. Spurred on by your dad’s claim that he’s “always wanted to
see <em>Washington Crossing the Delaware</em>,” you decide on <a
href="https://www.metmuseum.org/">the Met</a> as your alternative
activity.</p>
<p>But, after flashing your New York driver’s license at the admissions
desk for free entry and entering one of the world’s most esteemed art
museums, you discover your next problem: it’s huge. HUGE huge. With more
than <strong>600,000 square feet of gallery space</strong>, it’s not
only the 8th most visited art museum, but also the <strong>4th largest
in the world</strong> (beaten only by the <a
href="https://www.louvre.fr/en">Louve</a>, the <a
href="https://www.hermitagemuseum.org/wps/portal/hermitage/">State
Hermitage Museum</a> in Saint Petersburg, and the <a
href="https://en.chnmuseum.cn/">National Museum of China</a>). How can
you make sense of this vast collection of art available to you? Where do
you start?</p>

<h3>Project Motivation</h3>
<p>This project was inspired by experiences many of us have had while
visiting the Metropolitan Museum of Art, be it as first-time visitors or
regular attendees (thanks to pay-as-you-wish entry for NY students). The
museum houses some of the world’s greatest art, but its scale,
architectural complexity, and never-ending acquisitions make it
challenging to get a sense of what the collection actually contains.</p>
<p>Motivated by the intimidating vastness of the Met (and likely, our
pride in it as New York City residents), this analysis aims to provide a
high-level overview of art at the Met, explore how the museum’s
collection has changed over time, visualize the global sources of its
works, and dive into one its most well-known departments: Egyptian Art.
Our overarching goal is to both help future visitors feel more prepared
for a trip to the Met and give those not in New York a sense of its
impressive collection from a distance.</p>
</div>
<div id="related-work" class="section level3">
<h3>Related Work</h3>
<p>Our discovery of how fun and satisfying it is to make and use
interactive plots in R (such as with <a
href="https://plotly.com/r/">plotly</a>) drew us to a topic that would
have lots of opportunities for visualization. Additionally, a few
members of our group have specific experience with spatial epidemiology,
so working with data like this that allows for map creation was a good
fit for our academic backgrounds.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="initial-questions" class="section level1">
<h1>Initial Questions</h1>
<p>Once we decided to explore The Met with data. We asked these initial
questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>What does the Met contain?</em></li>
<li><em>Where does art come from across culture, dynasties, time, and
beyond?</em></li>
<li><em>How can we explore the Met more easily?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The Met’s data as overwhelming as The Met, we had to narrow down our
focus. Although the database contains <strong>a lot</strong> of data, it
also lacked data in certain variables. We decided to work with the
variables with the most complete data and developed the following
questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>What kind of objects does each department hold?</em></li>
<li><em>With Egyptian Art being so popular, what do its objects tell
us?</em></li>
<li><em>How has the Met changed over time?</em></li>
<li><em>Where does the art in the Met come from?</em></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="data-collection-and-cleaning" class="section level1">
<h1>Data Collection and Cleaning</h1>
<div id="data-source" class="section level3">
<h3>Data Source</h3>
<p>Since its beginning in 1870, The Metropolitan Museum (The Met) has
acquired and displayed over 5,000 years worth of art work from around
the world.</p>
<p>Thankfully for us data scientists, The Met offers open access to data
of its collection. They did this to encourage interaction with the
museum’s collection, and to help people around the world to use the
wealth of data they have stored on an impressive number of artefacts.
The dataset can be found <a
href="https://github.com/metmuseum/openaccess">here</a>, for anyone
interested in running their own analyses or reproducing ours.</p>
</div>
<div id="generating-our-sample" class="section level3">
<h3>Generating our Sample</h3>
<p>The Met dataset consists of over 400,000 artistic pieces. If you
think the Met is overwhelming to get through now - just imagine if all
of the artworks in storage were also on display. Sadly a dataset of this
size is too much even for us art aficionados, so we decided to divide
and conquer (which fittingly is how many of the artifacts from around
the world ended up in an American Art Museum).</p>
<p>A dataset of this size is far too big to handle, as any analysis
would take an excessively long time to process. Given this scale, we
decided that it would be wise to just work with a smaller, more
manageable subset of the data.</p>
<p>Using the code below, we took a random sample of 10% of the data,
creating our final dataset of over 40,000 observations. You can use this
code to create the same subset we did from The Met’s raw data file
<code>MetOBjects.txt</code>:</p>
<pre><code>-   `set.seed(1)`

-   `met_10 &lt;- sample_n(MetOBjects, nrow(MetOBjects)*.10)`

-   `save(met_10, file = &quot;data/met_10.RData&quot;)`</code></pre>
<p>Once we had our 10% sample (amounting to 48,495 observations), we
embarked on some data cleaning.</p>
<div id="first-we-looked-into-which-variables-were-the-most-complete."
class="section level4">
<h4>First, we looked into which variables were the most complete.</h4>
<p>The following table shows the % completeness for all variables.</p>
<p>Across all observations, <code>object_name</code> and
<code>accession_year</code> were most complete. <code>department</code>
was 100% complete. This informed which analytic questions we could
answer.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>met_10 &lt;- met_10 %&gt;%

<p>Based on the missing data table, and our decision to focus on objects
and years, we once again limited the dataset to those observations with
complete object and year data - resulting in a final analytic dataset
with 47,984 observations and 54 variables.</p>
<p>All in all, we chose the following variables to work with:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>is_highlight</code>: When “true” indicates a popular and
important artwork in the collection</li>
<li><code>department</code>: Indicates The Met’s curatorial department
responsible for the artwork</li>
<li><code>accession_year</code>: Year the artwork was acquired</li>
<li><code>culture</code>: Information about the culture, or people from
which an object was created</li>
<li><code>object_name</code>: Describes the physical type of the
object</li>
<li><code>country</code>: Country where the artwork was created or
found</li>
<li><code>subregion</code>: Geographic location more specific than
Region, but less specific than Locale, where the artwork was created or
found</li>
<li><code>object_begin_date</code>: Date indicating the year the artwork
was started to be created</li>
<li><code>object_end_date</code>: Date indicating the year the artwork
was completed</li>
<li><code>dynasty</code>: Dynasty (a succession of rulers of the same
line or family) under which an object was created</li>
</ul>

<h4>Second, we took a closer look at the variables of interest.</h4>
<p>We noticed that the values in <code>object_name</code> were far too
detailed for our purpose. For example, who needs to differentiated
between a relief fragment from the <em>Tomb of Maketre</em> and a relief
fragment form the <em>Tomb of Nespekashuty</em>? If you want to, don’t
run this code. But we consolidated object types, like <em>reliefs</em>,
to create better summaries.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>met &lt;- met %&gt;%

    grepl(&quot;Textile&quot;, object_name), &quot;Textile&quot;,

<p>Yet, as we transported ourselves to Ancient Egypt and the Met’s many
excavations in the area, we had to take some additional steps to dust
off the data without hurting the artifacts. <code>Dynasty</code> was a
key variable for the Egyptian data, as the Egyptian Art Department is
the only Department in the Met to have fairly well-identified Dynasties,
we felt it was important to include it. However, instead of keeping to
the traditional 30 Dynasties of Egypt, many of the observations were
coded as “Dynasty 1-5” or “second half 11.” We deep cleaned the table.
Strategy was that if a Dynasty was easily identifiable from the name
then we recoded the value to said Dynasty, if the value was of a
consecutive dynasty ex: “Dynasty 12-13” then we kept the value as said
Dynasty but only if that specific value was common in the data
(n&gt;20). This was to prevent having 50+ dynasty ranges and making
visualization tedious. Moreover, for larger Dynastic Ranges (or low
artifact count consecutive dynasties) these were just recoded as Dynasty
Range. Any other values were coded as NA.</p>
<p>Some other minor cleaning of the Egyptian data also occurred for
object creation dates.</p>

<h2>Department digging</h2>
<p>As we explored the many departments at The Met, the department with
the most objects is <em>Drawings and Prints</em> with 4 times as many
objects as the next department! (Interestingly enough, works on paper
can only be in exhibition ~3 months at a time due to their fragility.)
Yet that changes when looking at the most highlighted objects, or
popular pieces of artwork, as the department with the most highlighted
number of objects is <em>The American Wing</em>. Close behind <em>The
American Wing</em>, <em>Asian Art</em> comes in second with the most
highlighted objects.</p>

<p>As we explore each department and the objects they hold, we find that
<em>Drawings and Prints</em> mostly contains drawings and prints (no
surprise there). In <em>Drawings and Prints</em>, prints has more than
triple the number of objects than the other objects.
<em>Photographs</em> also mainly contains photographs (again, not
shocking and 3 times the number of objects compared to the other
objects). The most common object was a piece in both <em>Asian Art</em>
and <em>European Sculpture and Decorative Arts</em>.</p>
<p>Unlike any other department, <em>Greek and Roman Art</em> mostly
contains Kylix fragments (nearly 8 times any other object!). Kylix
fragments, or vessels, are specific to Greek and Roman culture. Again,
unlike any other department, the <em>Egyptian Art</em> department has
objects like reliefs, or painted scenes, and scarabs, or beetle shaped
amulets, specific to Egyptian culture.</p>
<p>The only department with only two types of objects (paintings and
drawings) was <em>European Paintings</em>. Finally, let’s discuss a
collection close to us at CUMC: <em>The Cloisters</em>. This collection
mostly contains panel, Pilgrim’s badge, and capital. Most of the art
displayed at <em>The Cloisters</em> is in fact part of <em>The Medieval
Art</em> department.</p>

<h2>Trends analysis</h2>
<p>As The Met’s collection contains many unknown or NA values, we
decided to use the variables with the most complete data. We also
decided that the best way to depict the Met would be with visuals worthy
of being in the Met itself. Because The Met’s database mainly contained
categorical variables, we mainly focused on the quantity of objects,
cultures, and object types. We made sure to use the one continuous
variable we had (<code>accession_year</code>) to depict the Met over
time.</p>
<p>When browsing through The Met dataset, we immediately noticed the
completeness of the year variable, <code>accession_year</code>, which
represents the year that a specific object was acquired by the museum.
The following plot shows the distribution of acquisition years in our
data - quite impressive!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(met, aes(x = accession_year)) + 
  geom_histogram(color = &quot;#0B775E&quot;, fill = &quot;#a7ba42&quot;, binwidth = 10) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1860, 2030, by = 10)) +
  labs(title = &quot;Distribution of the year objects were acquired&quot;,
       y = &quot;Number of objects&quot;,

<h3>Growth over time</h3>
<p>This prompted us to take a deeper dive and look at the growth over
time by department. For example, did all of them have a spike in object
acquisitions in the 1960s and 2010s? For this, we build an interactive
plot which you can also find in Exhibit C: The Met’s Growing
Collection.</p>

<p>Now, we can hover over or zoom into parts of the trend line that look
interesting. For example, what happened in 2011 with Greek and Roman
Art? A google search revealed nothing, so maybe it was just a
particularly productive year for that department’s curator. More
interestingly, however, is the year 1963, in which the department of
Drawings and Prints acquired over 4,000 objects.</p>
<p><em>What happened in the Drawings and Prints department in
1963?</em></p>
<p>Well, first we searched the world wide web. Turns out, <a
href="https://www.metmuseum.org/perspectives/videos/2021/1/from-the-vaults-leonardo-da-vinci-mona-lisa">the
<em>Mona Lisa</em> was added to The Met in 1963!</a></p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<img src="images/Mona-Lisa.jpeg" style="width:100%;">
<p style="font-size: smaller;">
<em>A crowd forms around the Mona Lisa (1963)</em>
</p>
</div>
<p>But that can’t be the reason for the uptick in objects acquired. The
<em>Mona Lisa</em> is just one painting.</p>
<p>If we take a look at the top 10 artists in that department in that
year, we see that many are not individual people at all - they are
almost all related to tobacco companies.</p>

<p>Pretty interesting since the National Institutes for Health released
their report on Smoking and Health in 1964! It must have been a hot
topic in 1963.</p>

<h3>Big years at The Met</h3>
<p>This led us to explore not just trends in object acquisitions, but
also “big” years in The Met’s history. With a little data wrangling, we
were able to identify three types of standout years, by department: 1.
When it had the highest number of objects 2. When it represented the
highest number of unique cultures 3. When it represented the highest
number of (known) woman artists</p>
<p>We created three plots to visualize these “big” years across
departments. It turned out each department at the Met has quite the
different story.</p>

<p>This plot is not too surprising since it shows more clearly what we
were interpreting from the trend lines. But now we can see that three

should hurry over to those departments on our next Met visit.</p>

<p>Interestingly, departments have not peaked in their
representation-factor in recent years. Most were most diverse between
the years of 1880 and 1980. But once again, <em>the Costume
Institute</em> is looking the most interesting for a present-day
visit…</p>

<h4>Departments at their most representative of women artists</h4>
<p><em>In which year was each department most representative of women
artists?</em></p>
<p>Note: our data issue in this chart is that for many objects, gender
of the artist is unknown! This table shows the proportion of objects
with known (men, women) and unknown genders:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>met %&gt;% select(artist_gender) %&gt;%
  mutate(Gender = ifelse(is.na(artist_gender), &quot;Unknown&quot;, 
                         ifelse(grepl(&quot;Female&quot;, artist_gender), &quot;Women&quot;, &quot;Men&quot;))) %&gt;%
  janitor::tabyl(Gender) %&gt;% 
  janitor::adorn_pct_formatting(rounding = &quot;half up&quot;, digits = 0)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   Gender     n percent
##      Men  9156     19%
##  Unknown 37418     78%
##    Women  1410      3%</code></pre>
<p>Sadly, we don’t know the artist’s gender for 78% of objects.
Nonetheless, we wanted to see, among those objects with gender
information, which departments were centering women artists and when. We
expect, however, that these data reflect more modern eras in which it
would have been easier to discern details about the artist.</p>

<p>Entering into the data analysis of the Egyptian Art Department,
<code>dynasty</code> was identified as the most important variable to
focus on. The Egyptian Arts Department is unique among Met Collections
in that for art of its age, it is far more complete information wise
than other contemporary regions. Nevertheless, many of these artifacts
were 3000 to 4000 years old, so the data was not perfect. As such, a
focus on <code>dynasty</code> required a high amount of data cleaning as
described above. Many artifacts that could be roughly placed timeline
wise needed to be placed into the overfill category due to lack of
specificity.</p>
<p>Because Dynasty was considered so central to our understanding of
Ancient Egyptian Art - Dynasty represent the political periods of Egypt,
so we theorized they would have a large impact of the art of the time -
we created a Shiny Dashboard whose reactive elements responded to Check
Box <code>dynasty</code> selections.</p>

<h2>World Map</h2>
<p>As a group, we aimed to illustrate the original countries of the
items in the MET. In order to that we decided that we will count the
total number of items per country and will create a map so that everyone
can access it see how many items originated from which country. In
addition to that, we wanted to show the top 20 countries since the data
is big and it is not possible to show every country. Also, we wanted
report the items without certain country or missing variables.</p>
<p>Data cleaning for the world map started with merging out cleaned met
data with the world data from <code>rnaturalearth</code> package. This
world data contains information about countries and locations such as
longitudes and latitudes. However, after merging, it has come to our
attention that our <code>country</code> variable in our data need some
more cleaning. Some of the Countries were not recorded as the same
format in world data. This difference created more missing data on
countries and total number of objects. In order to fix that, we changed
the name of the countries in our met data to be the same as the name of
the countries in the world data. We also created another merged data
that contains the data with the countries that did not match the names
in the world data.</p>

<h2>The MET Floor Maps including The Cloisters</h2>
<p>In order to show the total object numbers in different departments,
we decided to create a floor maps that shows different departments.
Although <code>The Cloisters</code> are not in the MET Upper East Side
location, we wanted to create a map for <code>The Cloisters</code>
because our explatory analysis showed that it was one of the departments
with least object. In order to create maps for each floor including
<code>The Cloisters</code>, we accessed longititudes and latitutes of
each departments’ location using the map inside the MET website (<a

). We only created the maps for the first, second, and G floor because
those were the floors that included the departments that we are
interested in. We added total number of objects in our maps so that
visitors can decide which department they want to prioritize when they

<p>We found that objects varied department to department. Some
departments were very specific to a culture (such as <em>Egyptian

specific to a specific kind of object (such as <em>Drawings and
Prints</em> and <em>European Paintings</em>). The largest department by
far is <em>Drawings and Prints</em> with over 17k of objects (in our 10%
sample, meaning even more owned by The Met!). <em>The Cloisters</em>
being the smallest department as it is a different museum branch.</p>
<p>Since <em>Drawings and Prints</em> is located on the first floor, the
visitors might spend more time there. In terms of the distribution of
culture oriented(such as <em>Egyptian Art</em> and <em>Greek and Roman
Art</em>) or object oriented departments(such as <em>Drawings and
Prints</em> and <em>European Paintings</em>), they spread around in the
first and second floor mostly. Floor G only includes two departments (
<em>Robert Lehman Collection</em> and <em>Costume Institute</em>),
however <em>Costume Institute</em> offers a big collection.</p>
<p>In addition, our analysis showed that the country with the most
objects is <code>Egypt</code>. After <code>Egypt</code>, most of the
items are from <code>United States</code>, <code>Iran</code>,
<code>Peru</code> and <code>Mexico</code>. 93 items in the MET
collection is uncertain, indicating that these items were recorded as
being from two or three countries, or the experts were unsure about the
specific country, providing multiple possibilities. Some items were
recorded as belonging to two or more countries, which proves that border
changes throughout the history affected the where the art belonged.
40840 items in the MET have missing <code>country</code> variables.</p>

<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>Our biggest challenge was working with such a large database (solved
by taking a 10% sample) and largely working with categorical variables.
There was only so much that can be done in terms of graphs due to the
nature of the data. We felt that visuals were the most important way to
showcase The Met and leaned into not only bar and line graphs but also
mapping.</p>
<p>Creating maps with The MET data was challenging because some of the
countries were not recorded well. In same cases, the records include old
country names or designate certain territories as countries, or they
were coded as a region of a country. Since the data is mostly
categorical, we were limited at what to include in the map. The
variables that we were interested in including our analysis were
<code>culture</code>, <code>reign</code>, <code>dynasty</code>,
<code>is_highlight</code>, <code>accession_year</code>,
<code>object_name</code>, <code>subregion</code>,
<code>subregion</code>, and <code>object_end_date</code>. The only
variables that we could use in our maps were the <code>country</code>
and <code>object_name</code>.</p>

<div id="limitations-and-future-challenges" class="section level2">
<h2>Limitations and Future Challenges</h2>
<p>Some limitations may include not using the true size of The Met Open
Access data.</p>
<p>For the future, we would like to see how British Museum is compared
to The MET. We think that it would be so interesting to compare these
two museums. Another future challenge might be comparing the top five
most visited museums such as Louvre(Paris), Vatican Museums(Vatican
City), Natural History Museum(London), British Musem(London), Natural
Museum of Natural History(Washington DC). In addition, New York City
Museums such as the MET, American Museum of Natural History, MOMA, and
Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum can be compared in terms of visitors,
ticket purchases, and frequency of visitors in different seasons.</p>
