# Project Motivation & Related Work
## A Familiar Story

Your parents are in town. It's raining, so your plan to pleasantly stroll through Central Park and watch tourists row backwards on the Lake is squashed. Spurred on by your dad's claim that he's "always wanted to see *Washington Crossing the Delaware*," you decide on [the Met](https://www.metmuseum.org/) as your alternative activity. 

But, after flashing your New York driver's license at the admissions desk for free entry and entering one of the world's most esteemed art museums, you discover your next problem: it's huge. HUGE huge. With more than **600,000 square feet of gallery space**, it's not only the 8th most visited art museum, but also the **4th largest in the world** (beaten only by the [Louve](https://www.louvre.fr/en), the [State Hermitage Museum](https://www.hermitagemuseum.org/wps/portal/hermitage/) in Saint Petersburg, and the [National Museum of China](https://en.chnmuseum.cn/)). 
How can you make sense of this vast collection of art available to you? Where do you start?

## Project Motivation

This project was inspired by experiences many of us have had while visiting the Metropolitan Museum of Art, be it as first-time visitors or regular attendees (thanks to pay-as-you-wish entry for NY students). The museum houses some of the world's greatest art, but its scale, architectural complexity, and never-ending acquisitions make it challenging to get a sense of what the collection actually contains.

Motivated by the intimidating vastness of the Met (and likely, our pride in it as New York City residents), this analysis aims to provide a high-level overview of art at the Met, explore how the museum's collection has changed over time, visualize the global sources of its works, and dive into one its most well-known departments: Egyptian Art. Our overarching goal is to both help future visitors feel more prepared for a trip to the Met and give those not in New York a sense of its impressive collection from a distance. 

## Related Work

Our discovery of how fun and satisfying it is to make and use interactive plots in R (such as with [plotly](https://plotly.com/r/)) drew us to a topic that would have lots of opportunities for visualization. Additionally, a few members of our group have specific experience with spatial epidemiology, so working with data like this that allows for map creation was a good fit for our academic backgrounds.

# Initial Questions

After deciding to focus our analysis on the Met, we began asking some initial questions. At this point, the contents of both the Met and its dataset remained pretty unknown, so are questions were general ones motivated by our confusion as visitors. They included:

* *What exactly does the Met contain?*
* *Where does the museum art come from in terms of cultures, dynasties, and time?*
* *How can we explore the Met more easily?*

Once we discovered the vastness of the available data and the significant missingness present for many of its variables, we knew we had to narrow our focus. We decided to work with the variables with the most complete data and refined our questions to be more specific, based on the information we knew would be available:

* *What kind of objects does each department hold?*
* *With Egyptian Art being so popular, what do its objects tell us?*
* *How has the Met changed over time? What do trends in acquisitions look like?*
* *Where in the world does the art in the Met come from?*

# Data Collection and Cleaning

         "#a7ba42", "#f94f8a", "#DD8D29")
```

## Data Source

Since its beginning in 1870, The Metropolitan Museum (The Met) has acquired and displayed over 5,000 years worth of art work from around the world. 

Thankfully for us data scientists, The Met offers open access to data of its collection. They did this to encourage interaction with the museum's collection, and to help people around the world to use the wealth of data they have stored on an impressive number of artefacts. The dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/metmuseum/openaccess), for anyone interested in running their own analyses or reproducing ours. 

## Generating our Sample

The Met dataset consists of over 400,000 artistic pieces. If you think the Met is overwhelming to get through now - just imagine if all of the artworks in storage were also on display. Sadly a dataset of this size is too much even for us art aficionados, so we decided to divide and conquer (which, fittingly, is how many of the artifacts from around the world ended up in an American art museum). 

A dataset of this size is far too big to handle, as any analysis would take an excessively long time to process. Given this scale, we decided that it would be wise to just work with a smaller, more manageable subset of the data.

Using the code below, we took a random sample of 10% of the data, creating our final dataset of over 40,000 observations. You can use this code to create the same subset we did from The Met's raw data file `MetOBjects.txt`:

    -   `set.seed(1)`

    -   `met_10 <- sample_n(MetOBjects, nrow(MetOBjects)*.10)`

    -   `save(met_10, file = "data/met_10.RData")`
    
Once we had our 10% sample (amounting to `r format(nrow(met_10), big.mark=",")` observations), we embarked on some data cleaning.

## Checking for Completeness

First, we looked into which variables were the most complete, based percentage of works having data recorded for that characteristic. 

The following table shows the % completeness for all variables. 
```{r }
met_10 <- met_10 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()

data.frame(sapply(met_10, function(x) round(sum(!is.na(x))/nrow(met_10)*100,2))) %>%
  magrittr::set_colnames("Completeness") |> 
  arrange(desc(Completeness)) |> 
  head(15)
```

Across all observations, `object_name` and `accession_year` were some of the most complete. `department` was 100% complete. This informed which analytic questions we could answer.

Based on the missing data table and our decision to focus on objects and years, we once again limited the dataset to those observations with complete object and year data - resulting in a final analytic dataset with `r format(nrow(met), big.mark=",")` observations and `r format(ncol(met), big.mark=",")` variables.

All in all, we chose the following variables to work with: 

* `department`: Indicates The Met's curatorial department responsible for the artwork
* `accession_year`: Year the artwork was acquired
* `culture`: Information about the culture, or people from which an object was created
* `object_name`: Describes the physical type of the object
* `country`: Country where the artwork was created or found
* `subregion`: Geographic location more specific than Region, but less specific than Locale, where the artwork was created or found
* `object_begin_date`: Date indicating the year the artwork was started
* `object_end_date`: Date indicating the year the artwork was completed
* `dynasty`: Dynasty (a succession of rulers of the same line or family) under which an object was created

## Cleaning Up Categorization

With the scope of our analytic dataset decided, we now turned our attention to the actual contents of the included variables. First, we noticed that the values in `object_name` were far too detailed for our purposes. For example, who needs to differentiate between a relief fragment from the _Tomb of Maketre_ and a relief fragment form the _Tomb of Nespekashuty_? If you want to, don't run the code below. But we consolidated object types, like _reliefs_, to create simpler and clearer summaries.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
met <- met %>%
  mutate(object_name = ifelse(
    grepl("Textile", object_name), "Textile",
    ifelse(grepl("Painting", object_name), "Painting",
    ifelse(grepl("Relief", object_name), "Relief",
    ifelse(grepl("Print", object_name), "Print", 
           ifelse(grepl("aseball card", object_name), "Baseball card", 
                  ifelse(grepl("Vase", object_name), "Vase", 
                         ifelse(grepl("rnament", object_name), "Vase", 
                                ifelse(grepl("arring", object_name), "Earring", 
                                       ifelse(grepl("ecklace", object_name), "Necklace", 
                                              ifelse(grepl("hotograph", object_name), "Photograph", 
                                                     ifelse(grepl("tatue", object_name), "Statue", 
           object_name))))))))))))
```

As we transported ourselves to Ancient Egypt and the Met's many excavations in the area, we had to take some additional steps to dust off the data without hurting the artifacts. `Dynasty` was a key variable for the Egyptian data; because the Egyptian Art Department is the only Department in the Met to have fairly well-identified dynasties, we felt it was important to include it. However, instead of keeping to the traditional 30 Dynasties of Egypt, many of the observations were coded as "Dynasty 1-5" or "second half 11." 

To harmonize the `Dynasty` variable, we used the following strategy: 

* If the intended dynasty was easily identifiable from the name, we recoded the variable to said dynasty
* If the value was of a consecutive dynasty (for example, "Dynasty 12-13"), we kept the value the same, but only if that specific value was common in the data (n>20). This was to prevent having 50+ dynasty ranges and making visualization tedious. 
* If the value was of an infrequently occurring consecutive dynasty, or for larger dynastic range, we recoded the variable to "Dynasty Range"
* Any other values were coded as NA

Some other minor cleaning of the Egyptian data also occurred for object creation dates.

# Exploratory Analysis

## Departmental Digging

The Met holds many collections, from Modern and Contemporary Art to Arms and Armor. Click [here](https://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-met/collection-areas) to learn more about each department, or collection area.

As we explored the many departments at the Met, the found that the department with the most objects is [_Drawings and Prints_](https://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-met/collection-areas/drawings-and-prints), with 4 times as many objects as the next largest department! This, of course, might be explained by the small and easily storable dimensions of most prints, in comparison to statues or reliefs (interestingly, works on paper can only be exhibited for ~3 months at a time due to their fragility).

```{r out.width='100%'}
met |> 
  count(department) |> 
  mutate(department = fct_reorder(department, n)) |> 
  plot_ly(x = ~department, y = ~n, color = ~department, type = "bar", colors = mypal) |>
  layout(title = 'Number of objects per department',
         xaxis = list(title = 'Department'), 
         yaxis = list(title = 'Number of objects'),
         showlegend = FALSE)
```

But, when focusing specially on highlighted objects (essentially, popular artworks), the rankings change, with [_The American Wing_](https://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-met/collection-areas/the-american-wing) being the department with the most objects. Close behind _The American Wing_, [_Asian Art_](https://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-met/collection-areas/asian-art) comes in second with the most highlighted objects.

```{r out.width='100%'}
met |> 
  filter(is_highlight == TRUE) |>
  count(department) |> 
  mutate(department = fct_reorder(department, n)) |> 
  plot_ly(x = ~department, y = ~n, color = ~department, type = "bar", colors = mypal) |>
  layout(title = 'Number of highlighted objects per department',
         xaxis = list(title = 'Department'), 
         yaxis = list(title = 'Number of highlighted objects'),
         showlegend = FALSE)
```

As we explore each department and the objects they hold, we find that _Drawings and Prints_ mostly contains drawings and prints (no surprise there). In Drawings and Prints, the number of prints is more than triple the count of any other object types.[_Photographs_](https://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-met/collection-areas/photographs) also mainly contains photographs (again, unsurprisingly, and with photographs outnumbering other objects in the department 3 to 1). A "piece" is the most common object in both _Asian Art_ and [_European Sculpture and Decorative Arts_](https://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-met/collection-areas/european-sculpture-and-decorative-arts).

  <p style="font-size: smaller;"><em>Burning Weeds</em>, Vincent Van Gogh (1883)</p>
</div>

Unlike any other department, _Greek and Roman Art_ mostly contains Kylix fragments (nearly 8 times as frequent as any other object!). Kylix fragments, or broken bits of ancient vessels, are specific to Greek and Roman culture. 

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="images/kylix.jpeg" style="width:100%;">
  <p style="font-size: smaller;">Kylix Fragments, Antiphon Painter (480 BCE)</p>
</div>

In the _Egyptian Art_ Department, unique objects include reliefs, or painted scenes, and scarabs, or beetle shaped amulets, specific to Egyptian culture.

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="images/winged_scarab.jpeg" style="width:100%;">
  <p style="font-size: smaller;">Winged Scarab (664 – 332 BC)</p>
</div>

The only department with only two types of objects is _European Paintings_, as it contains only paintings and drawings. Finally, let's discuss a collection close to us at the CUMC campus: [The Cloisters](https://www.metmuseum.org/visit/plan-your-visit/met-cloisters). The Cloisters collection largely consists of panel, Pilgrim's badge, and capital-type works. Most of the art displayed at The Cloisters is in fact part of _The Medieval Art_ Department.

For a department-by-department breakdown of the most common objects, including plots for each of the Met's many departments, see the [Exploring the Met's Departments](exploring_departments.html) page. 

## The Met's Changing Collection

Because the Met database mainly contained categorical variables, we largely focused our investigation on the quantity of objects, cultures, and object types. But, while working on data cleaning, we immediately noticed the completeness of the continuous year variable, `accession_year`, which represents the year that a specific object was acquired by the museum. As one of the main questions driving our investigation was about how The Met has changed in the 150+ years it's been open, we knew we could use this variable to examine trends over time. 

The following plot shows the distribution of acquisition years in our data - quite impressive!

```{r}
ggplot(met, aes(x = accession_year)) + 
  geom_histogram(color = "#0B775E", fill = "#a7ba42", binwidth = 10) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1860, 2030, by = 10)) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of objects acquired per year",
       y = "Number of objects", 
       x = "Year") + 
  theme_classic()
```

### Growth Over Time

This prompted us to take a deeper dive and look at the growth over time by department. For example, did all of them have a spike in object acquisitions in the 1960s and 2010s? For this, we built an interactive plot which you can also find in [Exhibition C: The Met's Growing Collection](growing_collection_dashboard.html).

```{r, message=FALSE}
met %>%
  group_by(accession_year, department) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(department) %>%
  plot_ly(
    x = ~accession_year, y = ~n, type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines',
    alpha = .9, color = ~department, colors = mypal,
    hoverinfo = 'text',
    text = ~paste("</br> Department: ", department, "</br> Year: ", accession_year, "</br> Number of objects: ", n)) %>% 
  layout(title = "Number of objects acquired by department over time",
         xaxis = list(title = "Year"),
         yaxis = list (title = "Number of objects",
                       tickformat=","),
         showlegend = FALSE)
```

Now, we can hover over or zoom into parts of the trend line that look interesting. For example, what happened in 2011 with Greek and Roman Art? A Google search revealed no answers, so maybe it was just a particularly productive year for that department's curator. More interestingly, however, is the year 1963, in which the department of Drawings and Prints acquired over 4,000 objects.

*What happened in the Drawings and Prints department in 1963?*

Well, first we searched the world wide web. Turns out, [the _Mona Lisa_ was shown at The Met in 1963!](https://www.metmuseum.org/perspectives/videos/2021/1/from-the-vaults-leonardo-da-vinci-mona-lisa)

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="images/Mona-Lisa.jpeg" style="width:100%;">
  <p style="font-size: smaller;">A crowd forms around the Mona Lisa (1963)</p>
</div>

But that can't be the reason for the uptick in objects acquired. The _Mona Lisa_ is just one painting. 

If we take a look at the top 10 artists in that department in that year, we see that many are not individual people at all - they are almost all related to tobacco companies. 

```{r}
met %>% filter(accession_year == 1963 & department == "Drawings and Prints") %>% group_by(artist_display_name) %>% summarize(n = n()) %>% arrange(desc(n)) %>% slice_max(n, n=10)
```

This is likely a result of a large acquisition of collectible trading cards produced by tobacco companies in the late 1800s and early 1900s. With the National Institutes for Health releasing their notable report on Smoking and Health the following year in 1964, it's possible that these tobacco companies were attempting to entrench themselves in American artistic culture and generate goodwill to combat growing criticism.

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="images/trading_cards.jpeg" style="width:100%;">
  <p style="font-size: smaller;">Collectible trading cards, by Honest Long Cut Tobacco, Miners Extra Tobacco, American Tobacco Company, and Kinney Brothers Tobacco Company (1901 - 1912)</p>
</div>

### Big Years at the Met

This led us to explore not just trends in object acquisitions, but also "big" years in the Met's history. With a little data wrangling, we were able to identify three types of standout years, by department: 1. When it had the highest number of objects 2. When it represented the greatest number of unique cultures 3. When it represented the highest number of (known) woman artists

We created three plots to visualize these "big" years across departments. It turned out that each department at the Met has quite the different story.

#### Departments at Their Largest

_In which year did each department have the most growth?_

```{r, message=FALSE}
met %>%
  group_by(department, accession_year) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  select(department, accession_year, n) %>%
  group_by(department) %>%
  slice(which.max(n)) %>%
  arrange(department) %>%
  plot_ly(
    y = ~n, x = ~accession_year, type = "scatter", mode = "markers",
    size = ~I(n*1.5), alpha = .9,
    color = ~department, colors = mypal,
    hoverinfo = 'text',
    text = ~paste("</br> Department: ", department, "</br> Year: ", accession_year, "</br> Number of objects: ", n)) %>% 
  layout(xaxis = list(title = "Year"),
         yaxis = list (title = "Number of objects",
                       tickformat=",")) %>%
  hide_legend()
```

This plot is not too surprising since it shows more clearly what we were interpreting from the trend lines. But now we can see that three departments have had more recent growth: _Greek and Roman Art_, _the Costume Institute_, and _Photographs_. Maybe we should hurry over to those departments on our next Met visit.

#### Departments at Their Most Culturally Diverse

_In which year was each department most representative of cultures from around the world?_

```{r, message=FALSE}
met %>%
  filter(!is.na(culture)) %>%
  mutate(culture = str_remove(culture, "possibly "),
         culture = str_remove(culture, "probably ")) %>%
  group_by(department, accession_year, .drop=FALSE) %>%
  summarize(n = n_distinct(culture)) %>%
  select(department, accession_year, n) %>%
  group_by(department) %>%
  slice(which.max(n)) %>%
  arrange(department) %>%
  plot_ly(
    y = ~n, x = ~accession_year, type = "scatter", mode = "markers",
    size = ~I(n*1.5), alpha = .9,
    color = ~department, colors = mypal,
    hoverinfo = 'text',
    text = ~paste("</br> Department: ", department, "</br> Year: ", accession_year, "</br> Number of cultures: ", n)) %>% 
  layout(xaxis = list(title = "Year"),
         yaxis = list (title = "Number of cultures",
                       tickformat=",")) %>%
  hide_legend()
```

Interestingly, departments have not peaked in their representation-factor in recent years. Many were most diverse between the years of 1880 and 1980. But once again, _the Costume Institute_ is looking the most interesting for a present-day visit...

#### Departments at Their Most Representative of Women Artists

_In which year was each department most representative of women artists?_

Note: our data issue in this chart is that for many objects, gender of the artist is unknown! This table shows the proportion of objects with known (men, women) and unknown genders:

```{r, message=FALSE}
met %>% select(artist_gender) %>%
  mutate(Gender = ifelse(is.na(artist_gender), "Unknown", 
                         ifelse(grepl("Female", artist_gender), "Women", "Men"))) %>%
  janitor::tabyl(Gender) %>% 
  janitor::adorn_pct_formatting(rounding = "half up", digits = 0)
```

Sadly, we don't know the artist's gender for 78% of objects. Nonetheless, we wanted to see, among those objects with gender information, which departments were centering women artists and when. We expect, however, that these data reflect more modern eras in which it would have been easier to discern details about the artist.

```{r, message=FALSE}
met %>%
  filter(!is.na(artist_gender)) %>%
  mutate(woman = ifelse(grepl("Female", artist_gender), 1, 0)) %>%
  group_by(department, accession_year) %>%
  summarize(n_woman = sum(woman)) %>%
    select(department, accession_year, n_woman) %>%
  group_by(department) %>%
  slice(which.max(n_woman)) %>%
  arrange(department) %>%
  plot_ly(
    y = ~n_woman, x = ~accession_year, type = "scatter", mode = "markers",
    size = ~I(n_woman*2), alpha = .9,
    color = ~department, colors = mypal,
    hoverinfo = 'text',
    text = ~paste("</br> Department: ", department, "</br> Year: ", accession_year, "</br> Number of objects: ", n_woman)) %>%
  layout(xaxis = list(title = "Year"),
         yaxis = list (title = "Number of objects by women",
                       tickformat=",")) %>%
  hide_legend()

```

Once again, _the Costume Institute_ has been the most impressive! We think we know exactly which department we're going to first.

## Geolocating Departments and Met Artwork

## Special deep-dives

Entering into the data analysis of the Egyptian Art Department, `dynasty` was identified as the most important variable to focus on. The Egyptian Art Department is unique among Met Collections in that for art of its age, it is far more complete information wise than other contemporary regions. Nevertheless, many of these artifacts were 3000 to 4000 years old, so the data was not perfect. As such, a focus on `dynasty` required a high amount of data cleaning as described above. Many artifacts that could be roughly placed timeline wise needed to be placed into the overfill category due to lack of specificity.

Because `dynasty` was considered so central to our understanding of Ancient Egyptian Art - Dynasty represent the political periods of Egypt, so we theorized they would have a large impact of the art of the time - we created a Shiny Dashboard whose reactive elements responded to Check Box `dynasty` selections.

library(sf)

shape_file <- st_read("data/EGY_adm1.shp")

## World Map
As a group, we aimed to illustrate the original countries of the items in The Met. In order to that we decided that we will count the total number of items per country and will create a map so that everyone can access it see how many items originated from which country. In addition to that, we wanted to show the top 20 countries since the data is big and it is not possible to show every country. Also, we wanted report the items without certain country or missing variables. 

Data cleaning for the world map started with merging out cleaned met data with the world data from `rnaturalearth` package. This world data contains information about countries and locations such as longitudes and latitudes. However, after merging, it has come to our attention that our `country` variable in our data need some more cleaning. Some of the Countries were not recorded as the same format in world data. This difference created more missing data on countries and total number of objects. In order to fix that, we changed the name of the countries in our met data to be the same as the name of the countries in the world data. We also created another merged data that contains the data with the countries that did not match the names in the world data. 

## The Met Floor Maps including The Cloisters
In order to show the total object numbers in different departments, we decided to create a floor maps that shows different departments. Although `The Cloisters` are not in The Met Upper East Side location, we wanted to create a map for `The Cloisters` because our exploratory analysis showed that it was one of the departments with least object. In order to create maps for each floor including `The Cloisters`, we accessed longitudes and latitudes of each departments' location using the map inside The Met [website](https://maps.metmuseum.org/?screenmode=base&floor=1&search=costume%20ins&feature=LTczLjk2MjEsNDAuNzgwM0BwaW5ANzk3ODc2MDA1ODg%3D#hash=18.24/40.780237/-73.962081/-61). We only created the maps for the first, second, and G floor because those were the floors that included the departments that we are interested in. We added total number of objects in our maps so that visitors can decide which department they want to prioritize when they are planning their trip. 

# Discussion


## Findings and Conclusions

We found that objects varied department to department. Some departments were very specific to a culture (such as _Egyptian Art_ and _Greek and Roman Art_). Other departments are more specific to a specific kind of object (such as _Drawings and Prints_ and _European Paintings_). The largest department by far is _Drawings and Prints_ with over 17k of objects (in our 10% sample, meaning even more owned by The Met!). _The Cloisters_ being the smallest department as it is a different museum branch. 

Since _Drawings and Prints_ is located on the first floor, the visitors might spend more time there. In terms of the distribution of culture oriented (such as _Egyptian Art_ and _Greek and Roman Art_) or object oriented departments(such as _Drawings and Prints_ and _European Paintings_), they spread around in the first and second floor mostly. Floor G only includes two departments ( _Robert Lehman Collection_ and _Costume Institute_), however _Costume Institute_ offers a big collection.

In addition, our analysis showed that the country with the most objects is `Egypt`. After `Egypt`, most of the items are from `United States`, `Iran`, `Peru` and `Mexico`. 93 items in The Met collection is uncertain, indicating that these items were recorded as being from two or three countries, or the experts were unsure about the specific country, providing multiple possibilities. Some items were recorded as belonging to two or more countries, which proves that border changes throughout the history affected the where the art belonged. 40840 items in The Met have missing `country` variables.

## Challenges 

Our biggest challenge was working with such a large database (solved by taking a 10% sample) and largely working with categorical variables. There was only so much that can be done in terms of graphs due to the nature of the data. We felt that visuals were the most important way to showcase The Met and leaned into not only bar and line graphs but also mapping. 

Creating maps with The Met data was challenging because some of the countries were not recorded well. In same cases, the records include old country names or designate certain territories as countries, or they were coded as a region of a country. Since the data is mostly categorical, we were limited at what to include in the map. The variables that we were interested in including our analysis were `culture`, `reign`, `dynasty`, `is_highlight`, `accession_year`, `object_name`, `subregion`, and `object_end_date`. The only variables that we could use in our maps were the `country` and `object_name`.

A minor challenge that came up was when creating `plotly` graphs for each department and their objects and it made the Exploring The Met's departments page very slow. We decided the best action would be to change from `plotly` to `ggplot` bar graphs for the department specific graphs.

## Limitations and Future Challenges

Some limitations may include not using the true size of The Met Open Access data. 

For the future, we would like to see how British Museum is compared to The Met. We think that it would be so interesting to compare these two museums. Another future challenge might be comparing the top five most visited museums such as Louvre (Paris), Vatican Museums (Vatican City), Natural History Museum (London), British Musem (London), Natural Museum of Natural History (Washington DC). In addition, New York City Museums such as the MET, American Museum of Natural History, MOMA, and Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum can be compared in terms of visitors, ticket purchases, and frequency of visitors in different seasons.
