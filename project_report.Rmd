# Project Motivation & Related Work
### A Familiar Story

Your parents are in town. It's raining, so your plan to pleasantly stroll through Central Park and watch tourists row backwards on the Lake is squashed. Spurred on by your dad's claim that he's "always wanted to see *Washington Crossing the Delaware*," you decide on [the Met](https://www.metmuseum.org/) as your alternative activity. 

But, after flashing your New York driver's license at the admissions desk for free entry and entering one of the world's most esteemed art museums, you discover your next problem: it's huge. HUGE huge. With more than **600,000 square feet of gallery space**, it's not only the 8th most visited art museum, but also the **4th largest in the world** (beaten only by the [Louve](https://www.louvre.fr/en), the [State Hermitage Museum](https://www.hermitagemuseum.org/wps/portal/hermitage/) in Saint Petersburg, and the [National Museum of China](https://en.chnmuseum.cn/)). 
How can you make sense of this vast collection of art available to you? Where do you start?

### Project Motivation

This project was inspired by experiences many of us have had while visiting the Metropolitan Museum of Art, be it as first-time visitors or regular attendees (thanks to pay-as-you-wish entry for NY students). The museum houses some of the world's greatest art, but its scale, architectural complexity, and never-ending acquisitions make it challenging to get a sense of what the collection actually contains.

Motivated by the intimidating vastness of the Met (and likely, our pride in it as New York City residents), this analysis aims to provide a high-level overview of art at the Met, explore how the museum's collection has changed over time, visualize the global sources of its works, and dive into one its most well-known departments: Egyptian Art. Our overarching goal is to both help future visitors feel more prepared for a trip to the Met and give those not in New York a sense of its impressive collection from a distance. 

### Related Work

Our discovery of how fun and satisfying it is to make and use interactive plots in R (such as with [plotly](https://plotly.com/r/)) drew us to a topic that would have lots of opportunities for visualization. Additionally, a few members of our group have specific experience with spatial epidemiology, so working with data like this that allows for map creation was a good fit for our academic backgrounds.

# Initial Questions
What questions are you trying to answer? How did these questions evolve over the course of the project? What new questions did you consider in the course of your analysis?

Our initial questions were "What does the Met contain?", "Where does art come from?", and "How can we explore the Met more easily?"




# Data Collection and Cleaning

### Data Source

The Met offers open access to data of its collection. It can be found [here](https://github.com/metmuseum/openaccess). 

### Data Cleaning

The Met dataset consists of over 400,000 artistic pieces. If you think the Met is overwhelming to get through now - just imagine if all of the artworks in storage were also on display. Sadly a dataset of this size is too much even for us art aficionados, so we decided to divide and conquer (which fittingly is how many of the artifacts from around the world ended up in an American Art Museum). 

We took a look at missing data to decide how to subset the dataset into a smaller, more manageable size. The variables `object_name` and `accession_year` were complete. From that information, we took a random sample of 10% of the data, creating our final dataset of over 40,000 observations.

```{r include = FALSE}
load("data/met.RData")
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
sapply(met, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
```

Based on the missing data, we chose the following variables to work with throughout: 

* `is_highlight`: When "true" indicates a popular and important artwork in the collection
* `department`: Indicates The Met's curatorial department responsible for the artwork
* `accession_year`: Year the artwork was acquired
* `culture`: Information about the culture, or people from which an object was created
* `object_name`: Describes the physical type of the object
* `country`: Country where the artwork was created or found
* `subregion`: Geographic location more specific than Region, but less specific than Locale, where the artwork was created or found
* `object_begin_date`: Date indicating the year the artwork was started to be created
* `object_end_date`: Date indicating the year the artwork was completed
* `dynasty`: Dynasty (a succession of rulers of the same line or family) under which an object was created

As we transported ourselves to Ancient Egypt and the Met's many excavations in the area, we had to take some additional steps to dust off the data without hurting the artifacts. `Dynasty` was a key variable for the Egyptian data, as the Egyptian Art Department is the only Department in the Met to have fairly well-identified Dynasties, we felt it was important to include it. However, instead of keeping to the traditional 30 Dynasties of Egypt, many of the observations were coded as "Dynasty 1-5" or "second half 11." We deep cleaned the table. Strategy was that if a Dynasty was easily identifiable from the name then we recoded the value to said Dynasty, if the value was of a consecutive dynasty ex: "Dynasty 12-13" then we kept the value as said Dynasty but only if that specific value was common in the data (n>20). This was to prevent having 50+ dynasty ranges and making visualization tedious. Moreover, for larger Dynastic Ranges (or low artifact count consecutive dynasties) these were just recoded as Dynasty Range. Any other values were coded as NA. 

Some other minor cleaning of the Egyptian data also occurred for object creation dates. 

# Exploratory Analysis
Visualizations, summaries, and exploratory statistical analyses. 

Justify the steps you took, and show any major changes to your ideas.

As the Met's collection contains many unknown or NA values, we decided to use the variables with the most complete data. We also decided that the best way to depict the Met would be with visuals worthy of being in the Met itself. Because the Met's database mainly contained categorical variables, we mainly focused on the quantity of objects, cultures, and object types. We made sure to use the one continuous variable we had (`accession_year`) to depict the Met over time. 

Entering into the data analysis of the Egyptian Art Department, `dynasty` was identified as the most important variable to focus on. The Egyptian Arts Department is unique among Met Collections in that for art of its age, it is far more complete information wise than other contemporary regions. Nevertheless, many of these artifacts were 3000 to 4000 years old, so the data was not perfect. As such, a focus on `dynasty` required a high amount of data cleaning as described above. Many artifacts that could be roughly placed timeline wise needed to be placed into the overfill category due to lack of specificity.

Because Dynasty was considered so central to our understanding of Ancient Egyptian Art - Dynasty represent the political periods of Egypt, so we theorized they would have a large impact of the art of the time - we created a Shiny Dashboard whose reactive elements responded to Check Box `dynasty` selections.
