# Project Motivation & Related Work
### A Familiar Story

Your parents are in town. It's raining, so your plan to pleasantly stroll through Central Park and watch tourists row backwards on the Lake is squashed. Spurred on by your dad's claim that he's "always wanted to see *Washington Crossing the Delaware*," you decide on [the Met](https://www.metmuseum.org/) as your alternative activity. 

But, after flashing your New York driver's license at the admissions desk for free entry and entering one of the world's most esteemed art museums, you discover your next problem: it's huge. HUGE huge. With more than **600,000 square feet of gallery space**, it's not only the 8th most visited art museum, but also the **4th largest in the world** (beaten only by the [Louve](https://www.louvre.fr/en), the [State Hermitage Museum](https://www.hermitagemuseum.org/wps/portal/hermitage/) in Saint Petersburg, and the [National Museum of China](https://en.chnmuseum.cn/)). 
How can you make sense of this vast collection of art available to you? Where do you start?

### Project Motivation

This project was inspired by experiences many of us have had while visiting the Metropolitan Museum of Art, be it as first-time visitors or regular attendees (thanks to pay-as-you-wish entry for NY students). The museum houses some of the world's greatest art, but its scale, architectural complexity, and never-ending acquisitions make it challenging to get a sense of what the collection actually contains.

Motivated by the intimidating vastness of the Met (and likely, our pride in it as New York City residents), this analysis aims to provide a high-level overview of art at the Met, explore how the museum's collection has changed over time, visualize the global sources of its works, and dive into one its most well-known departments: Egyptian Art. Our overarching goal is to both help future visitors feel more prepared for a trip to the Met and give those not in New York a sense of its impressive collection from a distance. 

### Related Work

Our discovery of how fun and satisfying it is to make and use interactive plots in R (such as with [plotly](https://plotly.com/r/)) drew us to a topic that would have lots of opportunities for visualization. Additionally, a few members of our group have specific experience with spatial epidemiology, so working with data like this that allows for map creation was a good fit for our academic backgrounds.

# Initial Questions
What questions are you trying to answer? How did these questions evolve over the course of the project? What new questions did you consider in the course of your analysis?

Our initial questions were "What does the Met contain?", "Where does art come from?", and "How can we explore the Met more easily?"




# Data Collection and Cleaning

### Data Source

The Met offers open access to data of its collection. It can be found [here](https://github.com/metmuseum/openaccess), for anyone interested in running their own analyses or reproducing ours. 

### Generating our Sample

The Met dataset consists of over 400,000 observations. A dataset of this size is far too big to handle, as any analysis would take an excessively long time to process. Given this scale, we decided that it would be wise to just work with a smaller, more manageable subset of the data.

To start, we looked into which variables were the most complete, and found that nearly every observation in the dataset had a value for the `object_name` and `accession_year` variables. Knowing that these would be important variables for our analyses, we restricted the dataset to only include observations with non-missing values for both variables. Then, we pulled a random 10% sample, creating our final dataset.

```{r include = FALSE}
load("data/met.RData")
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
sapply(met, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
```

^ NOT SURE WHAT THIS IS DOING?

IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE SOME INITIAL DESCRIPTORS OF OUR FINAL DATASET HERE, INCLUDING THE ROW AND OBSERVATION COUNT.

Based on the missing data, we chose the following variables to work with: 

* `is_highlight`: When "true" indicates a popular and important artwork in the collection
* `department`: Indicates The Met's curatorial department responsible for the artwork
* `accession_year`: Year the artwork was acquired
* `culture`: Information about the culture, or people from which an object was created
* `object_name`: Describes the physical type of the object
* `country`: Country where the artwork was created or found

# Exploratory Analysis
Visualizations, summaries, and exploratory statistical analyses. 

Justify the steps you took, and show any major changes to your ideas.

As the Met's collection contains many unknown or NA values, we decided to use the variables with the most complete data. We also decided that the best way to depict the Met would be with visuals worthy of being in the Met itself. Because the Met's database mainly contained categorical variables, we mainly focused on the quantity of objects, cultures, and object types. We made sure to use the one continuous variable we had (`accession_year`) to depict the Met over time.
