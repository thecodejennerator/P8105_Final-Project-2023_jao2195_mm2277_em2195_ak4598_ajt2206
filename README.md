Final Project for P8105 Data Science 

11/21 Meeting with TA

* Have we been able to download the format in a way that we could actually work with? Yes, Diana found where we can download a .csv fil with all objects and import it into a single dataframe
* Are we planning to include formal statistical analyses? Probably a few. TA says that if it's not a good fit or we can't get the formal analyses working properly, we don't have to include them
* ggplot probably has specialized visualizations (including color schemes) that could make our plots look pretty
* TA's recommendation: identify three main themes that our analyses will cover, and then include our planned analyses within that
* TA recommends adding dashboards to our website. If we can figure it out, a `shiny` dashboard might be more attractive than a `plotly` dashboard
* Reach out to Tvisha if we need any help
* Important that our analysis comprehensively covers the topic we've picked
* The report isn't a separate word file, it's just the analyses written within the R markdown file. The report is essentially the website
* We may run into issues with uploading the entire dataset into github. If it's taking forever/not working because the dataset is too big, can export portions as csv files and then just upload those to github. Can make different csv files based on different filtering criteria
* Divide out responsibilities: 2 on cleaning data and making plots, 2 on writing up the narrative about the results, 2 on making the website
