### Deliverable 1 - Project Top 
##########################################################################

#### Deliverables (General)
#### Submissions

Other than peer assessments, each deliverable will appear online (as e.g. a GH repo or youtube video). Links should be submitted via Courseworks by one team member (not necessarily the same person for each deliverable).

#### Team registration and proposal
First, you will define your teams and propose a project. This proposal should be a half-page to a page in length and include:

The group members (names and UNIs)
The tentative project title
The motivation for this project
The intended final products
The anticipated data sources
The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges
The planned timeline
There should be one proposal per group, written collaboratively using .Rmd (rendering to a GH document) in a dedicated GitHub repo. This is intended to describe a project that is in the planning stages. Only one team member should submit this proposal via Canvas.

Please also submit (only once per team) a list of your teamâ€™s UNIs using this form. Doing so will help us keep track of teams.
