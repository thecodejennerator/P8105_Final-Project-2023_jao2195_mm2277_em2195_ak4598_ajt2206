### General Instructions: Deliverables & Submissions
Other than peer assessments, each deliverable will appear online (as e.g. a GH repo or youtube video). 
Links should be submitted via Courseworks by one team member (not necessarily the same person for each deliverable).

There should be one proposal per group, written collaboratively using .Rmd (rendering to a GH document) in a dedicated GitHub repo. This is intended to describe a project that is in the planning stages. Only one team member should submit this proposal via Canvas.<br> [Submission Completed xxxxxxxxx XX]

Please also submit (only once per team) a list of your teamâ€™s UNIs using this form. Doing so will help us keep track of teams.<br> [Submission Completed Mon. November 6, 2023 JO ]
