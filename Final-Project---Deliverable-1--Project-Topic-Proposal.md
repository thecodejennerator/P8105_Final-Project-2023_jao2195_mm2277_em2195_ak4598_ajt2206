### Deliverable 1 - Project Topic Proposal

########################################################################## 

#### Deliverables (General)

#### Submissions

Other than peer assessments, each deliverable will appear online (as
e.g. a GH repo or youtube video). Links should be submitted via
Courseworks by one team member (not necessarily the same person for each
deliverable).

#### Team registration and proposal

First, you will define your teams and propose a project. This proposal
should be a half-page to a page in length and include:

1.  The group members (names and UNIs)

| Group_Members | UNIs    |
|:--------------|:--------|
| Jennifer Osei | jao2195 |
| Melike Aksoy  | mma2277 |
| Emily Murphy  | erm2195 |
| Aleya Khalifa | ak4598  |
| Andy Turner   | ajt2206 |

2.  The tentative project title
3.  The motivation for this project
4.  The intended final products
5.  The anticipated data sources
6.  The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges
7.  The planned timeline

There should be one proposal per group, written collaboratively using
.Rmd (rendering to a GH document) in a dedicated GitHub repo. This is
intended to describe a project that is in the planning stages. Only one
team member should submit this proposal via Canvas.

Please also submit (only once per team) a list of your team’s UNIs using
this form. Doing so will help us keep track of teams.\[Completed Mon.
