#### Deliverables (General)

#### Submissions

Other than peer assessments, each deliverable will appear online (as
e.g. a GH repo or youtube video). Links should be submitted via
Courseworks by one team member (not necessarily the same person for each
deliverable).

#### Team registration and proposal

First, you will define your teams and propose a project. This proposal
should be a half-page to a page in length and include:

1.  The group members (names and UNIs)

There should be one proposal per group, written collaboratively using
.Rmd (rendering to a GH document) in a dedicated GitHub repo. This is
intended to describe a project that is in the planning stages. Only one
team member should submit this proposal via Canvas. \[Submission
